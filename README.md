# Exploring React Native - MobileSpace

This repo serves as an introduction to React Native for MobileSpace Season 2

In this repo we will explore the RN ecosystem by creating a React Native app using `react-native-cli`, `crna` and `expo`. We will also get started with RN styling and use basic RN components such as View, ScrollView, ListView & Input components.
